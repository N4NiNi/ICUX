Despite being one of Africa's largest parks, Kafue is the least visited of Zambia's three major national parks. Located well off-the-beaten-track, Kafue National Park is still very, very wild and regarded as somewhat of a Zambian hidden gem.",

As the surface level of the water is 30 feet below the floor of the surrounding forest, Lake Kashiba is often referred to as a 'sunken lake'. While the surface area of the lake is small, it is incredibly deep with a depth of 330 feet around its sides. The depth of the centre of Lake Kashiba is however unknown, which has given rise to several mystical tales and legends of monsters below the surface. Despite the air of mystery that surrounds it, the bluish-green water of the lake is extremely welcoming, and it has become a popular destination for activities like fishing and swimming.",
